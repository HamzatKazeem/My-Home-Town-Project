      <h3>Football Heritage</h3>
      <img class="img-middlebanner-image" src="Images/football.jpg">

      <h4 id="header"> <b>The Origin of the Legendary Game of Football. </b></h4>
      <p>
        In 1855, members of a Sheffield cricket club organised informal kick-abouts without any official rules.<br><br>
        Subsequently, two members, Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, formed the Sheffield Football Club. <br><br>

        The inaugural meeting of the club took place on 24 October 1857 at Parkfield House in the suburb of Highfield in
        Sheffield. <br><br> The original headquarters was a greenhouse on East Bank Road lent to them by Thomas Asline
        Ward, father of the first club president Frederick Ward, and the adjacent field was used as their first playing
        ground. <br><br> Initially, Sheffield FC games were played among club members themselves and took the format of
        “Married v Singles” or “Professionals v the Rest”.
